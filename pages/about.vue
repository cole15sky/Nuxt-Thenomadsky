        <p class="text-blue-300-5xl"> <strong class="text-xl font-bold"> Once upon a time,</strong> inside a country called Nepal, in the shadow of the Himalayas, there was a boy who asked
            way too many questions, making his parents and teachers mad. Then, as the years went by he stopped asking
            silly questions. And started asking sillier ones - questions to do with life, death, coffee, semicolons and
            such.

        from <span className="purple"> Chitwan,Nepal.</span>
        <br />
        I am currently a student at TU-IOST.
        <br />
        I enjoy solving bugs and logical challanges.
        <br />
        <br /> Within the intricate dance of algorithms and codes, I find my passion ignited, constantly seeking to
        unravel the complexities that define the backbone of digital systems. Whether it's developing sleek and
        efficient software solutions or architecting robust network infrastructures, I am driven by the pursuit of
        excellence and the desire to contribute meaningfully to the technological landscape.
